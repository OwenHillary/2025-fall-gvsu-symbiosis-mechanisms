## Planning:

(1) Replicate Zaman et al. 2014 results that parasites drive complexity relative to no-symbiont control and to mutualist condition
- Flat reward structure
- Parasites vs. no-syms vs. mutualists
- Default synergy factor? 5
  - 1, 2, 4, 8
- Try no limits on number of tasks performed by hosts to replicate Zaman result

Some changes from previous runs:

- Align minimum repro cycles to Anya's students: 100 host/10 sym
- Reduce number of tasks to complete per repro from 2 to 1 (for simplicity of explanation)
- Explore different combinations of allowing hosts/syms to complete different numbers of tasks
