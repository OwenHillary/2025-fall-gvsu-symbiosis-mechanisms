In this experiment I am looking at the effects of the steal% along with host/sym repo rates.
Important notes - 
    All task are worth 10, 
    Host/Sym Repo rates are at 40,
    Syms get 2 resource w/o matching and 7x on a sucess
        - What I wanted to do but forgot to do was have the multipler change, so that one sucessfull match would cause a the sym to get to the mimium reasues to repo

    Host Lifespan -
        I use 4 and 64 cycles as 4 is min cycle for not/nand and 64 is the min cycle for Equ

        320 is used as it is the longest min time need for a host with a parsite to repo (at .8 steal)

        30 and 100 are just arbitray values meant to meet in the middle kinda

    Sym Lifespan - 
        1, 10, 100 just to repersent 3 speeds, 
        in hindsight I should of bumped up the middle value to be a better rep, also 1 - 4 are effectivly the same, 10 covers all of task but equal too

    Steal Prop
        What I am most intreasted in is how the steal prop drive co-evoultion.  I think the quicker

        I pick for values to cover the spread.

        You can almost think of this is how mean will it be.


    I pick these three test values because I think all three will have a bigg effect on how they change in reaction to each other.
