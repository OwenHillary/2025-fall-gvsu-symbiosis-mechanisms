# Notes from experiments / tinkering

For stress mutualists / parasites:
- When ousting, whether we favor current symbiont vs incoming symbiont matters.
  - For mutualist, important that VT is main mechanism of repro, so important that current symbiont is favored (to maintain relationship with host).
  - For parasite, important that HT is main mechanism of repro, better for incoming symbiont to be favored.
- When using strictly stronger matches for ousting, need to give hosts enough time between stress events to replenish population.
  - When using stronger or equal, it helps the host that they often get "new" offspring that haven't expressed any tasks yet, giving them a pass for that stress event.
