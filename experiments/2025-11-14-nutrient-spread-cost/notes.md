In these test we are really trying to resource limit the hosts/syms 

We are only varrying the host repo costs (Syms cost is set to half the host)

We want the sym to still be able to reproduce if they dont task mask so base % is 100%, however they steal 80% when they match and they recive an 8x mult.

We are setting the base reward to 1, to makes the mental math esaier.  

This is a very tricky scale to balance.
